Good news, Xfce has been accepted to [Google Summer of Code 2022](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/organizations/xfce) !

This time not only different thunar projects will be mentored, but as well some xfce4-terminal, xfce4-screenshooter and xfce4-panel projects. Check our [Xfce GSoC Wiki](https://wiki.xfce.org/projects/gsoc/start) for a detailed list of project ideas !

If you are not much involved into Xfce yet and interested in software development, now might be a good opportunity to contribute to Xfce while even getting payed for it !

In case you are already involved in Xfce development, you might be interested to mentor a GSoC contributor and add some project idea to the [ideas-list](https://wiki.xfce.org/projects/gsoc/start#project_ideas) for which you can do mentoring.

For more detailed information, best check the guides on the [official GSoC page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com).


Hope to see you there !
