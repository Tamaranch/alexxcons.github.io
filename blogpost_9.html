            <h2>An Estimate on the Total Number of Xfce Users</h2>

            <p>Recently, my wife asked me how many people in total actually use the software I develop in my free time (mostly <a href="https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start">thunar</a>).</p>

            <p>I never thought about that question, so I just made a wild guess. Based on the number of people I believed are active on the Xfce <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#xfce:matrix.org">Matrix</a> / IRC channels, I answered: "... maybe between 2000 and 10.000 people do use Xfce".</p>

            <p>I know nobody can give exact numbers. It's all about package downloads, OS types reported by browsers, and other more or less biased data harvesting.</p>

            <p>However, the question nagged me, so I searched for some more reliable numbers.</p>

            <p>Ubuntu came to my mind. Since it collects some user-data, I thought it might be a good starting point for my investigation.</p>

            <p>Via web search, I found out that <a href="http://webtribunal.net/blog/ubuntu-usage-statistics">there seem to be about 40 Million Ubuntu users</a>.</p>

            <p>According to <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-20-04-survey-results">this post</a>, 15% of them use Xubuntu.</p>

            <p>--&gt <b>6 million Xubuntu users</b> (holy crap)

            <p>Further digging revealed that <a href="https://truelist.co/blog/linux-statistics/">aproximately 33% of Linux desktop users use a Ubuntu based distro</a>.</p>
            
            <p>--&gt Approximately 120 million Linux desktop users in total</p>

            <p>--&gt Considering a rather conservative estimate of 10% Xfce users on non-Ubuntu systems --&gt <b>another 8 million installs</b></p>

            <p>That would be approximately <b>14 million Xfce users</b>. So many people do use the software I tinker with? /o\</p>
  
            <p>Considered that estimate is more or less accurate, than why are the Xfce communication channels rather calm?</p>

            <p>For example, we currently have around 6000 non-blocked accounts at <a href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/">gitlab.xfce.org</a>. That would be roughly one in every 2000 users (0,043%) who create an account. Can that be true?</p>

            <p>Since I was not sure if my numbers are reasonable, I asked for feedback <a href="https://forum.xfce.org/viewtopic.php?pid=75134">in the Xfce forums</a>.</p>

            <p>The estimate seems to be mostly fine. On the question about the rather low percentage of people who get in contact via official Xfce communication channels, there are several guesses:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If users are looking for answers to Xfce related problems, most of them search/ask on Reddit, Stack Exchange, ChatGPT, etc., or in distro specific channels.</li>
              <li>Xfce is a very stable DE. Many Xfce users probably don't try to get in contact because things just work fine for them.</li>
              <li>Many people might just use software "as is" and don't even bother to ask for any advice.</li>
           </ul>

            <p>I wanted to share this estimate with you, since for me, it was a surprise to see that such a huge number of people actually seem to use Xfce. Knowing so gives me even more motivation to further improve Xfce.</p>
