            <h2>Shiny new things in Thunar thanks to GSoC 2021</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">GSoC 2021</a> is over now and I am happy to tell you that both students working on thunar did an excellent job. Alot of nice stuff has been added thanks to them !</p>
            
            <p>In order to allow you to discover all these new features, <a href="https://mail.xfce.org/pipermail/xfce-announce/2021-September/001059.html">Thunar 4.17.5</a> was just released.
            (Note that this is a development release. It still might have some rough edges)</p>
            
            <p>For details about the new features check the summaries provided by Sergios and Yongha:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://users.uoa.gr/~sdi1800073/sources/xfce_blog05.html">Sergios GSoC Summary</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://dev.ikx.kr/GSOC-6th/">Yongha's GSoC Summary</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Besides these, here as well some more new features added during GSoC for which I thought they would be worth to mention:</p>
            <p></p>
            
            <p>Bookmarks got moved into a separate 'Bookmarks Menu' and a 'create bookmark' option was added
            (<a href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/-/merge_requests/109">MR !109</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/-/merge_requests/71">MR !71</a>)</p>
            
            <img class="full-img" src="images/blogpost_3/bookmark_menu.png" alt="bookmark menu"/>
            <p></p>
            <p>A new menu item "Set Default Application" was added to the "Open with" submenu (<a href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/-/merge_requests/79">MR !79</a>)</p>
            
            <img class="full-img" src="images/blogpost_3/default_app_1.png" alt="Open with - Set Default App"/>
            <p></p>
            <p>A new section 'Default Application' was added to the 'thunar-chooser-dialog' (<a href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/-/merge_requests/81">MR !81</a>)</p> 
            
            <img class="full-img" src="images/blogpost_3/default_app_2.png" alt="Default App Section"/>
            
            <p>On top there are still <a href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/-/merge_requests">various open merge requests</a> with partial finished features, most of them from GSoC students for which I did not find time so far.
            So expect more new stuff to arrive soon !</p>
            
            <p>You as well might want to keep an eye on <a href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/apps/xfce4-terminal">xfce4-terminal</a>, which received alot of activity recently, since it is now maintained by Sergios Kefalidis.</p>
            
            <p>If you find a bug on any of these new features, please make use of the <a href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/thunar">xfce bugtracker</a>.</p>
            
            <p>Happy testing !</p>
